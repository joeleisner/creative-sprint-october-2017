## Prompts
Here's a list of prompts that are contained within this repo.

### Day 9
Today is World Post Day! Create something inspired by the Postal Service and their work. I built a mailbox with an animated mailbox flag with HTML/CSS.

### Day 7
Recreate a famous work of art using material and technique of your choice. I built Piet Mondrian's "Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow" with HTML/CSS.

### Day 6
Use palindromes as your inspiration today. I built an HTML/CSS loader animation with a palindromic wave.

### Day 4
Create something using disposable plastic bags as your primary material. I struggled making something with actual disposable plastic bags, so I decided to take things digital by building a disposable plastic bag entirely from HTML/CSS.

### Day 2
Make something representing the origins or meanings of your name. My last name is "Eisner", an occupational name for an ironworker, smith, or ironmonger. It derives from the Middle High German "isen" and German "eisen", meaning "iron". I built an animated hammer/anvil entirely from HTML/CSS.
